<!-- ========== MARKET (PART 2) ========== -->
<div class="tab-content" id="market">
<h2>India Edible Oil Market — Imports, Storage & Processing</h2>

<p>
India is one of the world’s largest consumers and importers of edible oils. Despite being a
major agricultural economy, domestic oilseed production is structurally insufficient to
meet national demand. As a result, edible oil imports form a permanent and essential
component of India’s food supply chain rather than a temporary imbalance.
</p>

<p>
India’s annual edible oil consumption is estimated at <b>23–25 million metric tonnes</b>.
Domestic production supplies only a part of this requirement, and the balance is met
through imports of palm oil, soybean oil and sunflower oil. This structural dependency
makes India highly sensitive to global price movements, freight costs, currency volatility
and geopolitical developments.
</p>

<hr style="border-color:rgba(0,255,136,.35);margin:35px 0">

<h3>1. Import Origins & Vessel Movement</h3>

<p>
Palm oil imports are predominantly sourced from Indonesia and Malaysia, soybean oil from
South America (Argentina and Brazil), and sunflower oil from the Black Sea region. These
cargoes arrive through a mix of bulk vessels and containerised shipments depending on
origin, contract structure and port infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
India’s western coastline handles the majority of edible oil imports due to shorter
sailing times, deeper drafts and the presence of integrated liquid handling facilities.
Vessel scheduling, berth availability and discharge rates play a critical role in
execution efficiency and inventory planning.
</p>

<hr style="border-color:rgba(0,255,136,.35);margin:40px 0">

<h3>2. Container Yards, Tank Farms & Stock Holding</h3>

<p>
Once discharged at ports, edible oils are stored in port-side tank farms, bonded warehouses
and container yards before onward movement to refineries and inland consumption centres.
Container yards act as a critical buffer between port discharge and inland logistics,
especially for containerised imports.
</p>

<img src="images/container_yard.jpg"
style="width:100%;height:360px;object-fit:cover;border-radius:22px;
box-shadow:0 0 60px rgba(0,255,136,.6);margin:25px 0">

<p>
Ports such as Mundra, Kandla and JNPT collectively account for a significant share of India’s
edible oil stockholding. These ports are strategically linked to refinery clusters and
high-consumption regions across North and Western India.
</p>

<table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:18px">
<tr>
  <th style="color:#00ff88;text-align:left">Port</th>
  <th>Estimated Import Share</th>
  <th>Primary Role</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Mundra</td>
  <td>35–40%</td>
  <td>Bulk liquid handling & refinery linkage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Kandla</td>
  <td>25–30%</td>
  <td>Northern India distribution & tank farms</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>JNPT</td>
  <td>15–20%</td>
  <td>Containerised imports & inland supply</td>
</tr>
</table>

<hr style="border-color:rgba(0,255,136,.35);margin:40px 0">

<h3>3. Processing, Refining & Domestic Distribution</h3>

<p>
After clearance from ports and container yards, crude edible oils are transported to
refineries and processing plants. These facilities carry out refining, bleaching,
deodorisation and blending to meet domestic quality standards and consumption preferences.
</p>

<p>
Processing plants are typically located close to ports or major consumption centres to
optimise logistics costs and ensure steady supply. The refined output is then distributed
to FMCG manufacturers, food service operators, wholesale markets and retail channels.
</p>

<img src="images/processing_plant.jpg"
style="width:100%;height:360px;object-fit:cover;border-radius:22px;
box-shadow:0 0 60px rgba(0,255,136,.6);margin:25px 0">

<p>
National edible oil inventory coverage typically ranges between <b>30–45 days</b>, depending
on import pipeline strength, seasonal demand and price outlook. Inventory levels are
actively managed to balance price risk, storage costs and supply continuity.
</p>

<hr style="border-color:rgba(0,255,136,.35);margin:40px 0">

<h3>4. Annual Import Trend (Indicative)</h3>

<p>
India’s edible oil imports have shown a steady upward trend over recent years, driven by
population growth, rising per-capita consumption and limited scope for rapid domestic
oilseed expansion. Temporary fluctuations usually reflect policy interventions or global
supply disruptions rather than structural demand weakness.

<p style="font-size:0.95rem;margin-top:12px">
<b style="color:#00ff88">Green trend</b> indicates demand-led growth, while
<b style="color:#ff5c5c">red points</b> highlight stress periods due to freight or supply
volatility.
</p>

<hr style="border-color:rgba(0,255,136,.35);margin:40px 0">

<h3>5. Role of Brokerage in Physical Trade</h3>

<p>
In a high-volume import environment, brokers play a critical role in aligning contractual
terms with physical execution. This includes coordination between buyers, sellers,
inspection agencies, shipping lines and port operators.
</p>
